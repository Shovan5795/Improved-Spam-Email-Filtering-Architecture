# Improved-Spam-Email-Filtering-Architecture

Research on spam email filtering is drawing experts from all
over the world, as these junk email messages continue to affect peopleâ€™s
daily lives, whether consciously or unconsciously. The overwhelming use
of irritating, destructive, and misleading emails appears to have damaged
the values of email which prompted us to perform this research to construct a model for spam filtering with faster training time and enhanced
accuracy. We have proposed two voting architectures built upon machine learning models and ensemble classifiers respectively. In our work,
we have also analyzed the performance of several individually applied
classifiers and ensemble techniques with various feature retrieval strategies. Additionally, we have compared the training time of the proposed
models with the deep LSTM-CNN Hybrid model. Both of our suggested
models have performed adequately while the ML-based voting model
(Type 1) produces the most accurate filtering (98%) taking bag of words
for feature extraction and can be trained above 200 times faster than the
LSTM-CNN model.
